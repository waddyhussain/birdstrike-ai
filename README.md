# Birdstrike AI

## Description

A program that uses the NEAT-Python library to train an AI to play a game made using PyGame. The
objective of the game is to move a plane up and down in order to dodge birds that fly across the screen. The game can
also be played by the user (the difficulty settings for the game are slightly different when the AI plays it to when
the user plays it).


## Running the program

Download all the files and run `main.py`. By default, there will already be an AI instance that has been trained to
play the game.
